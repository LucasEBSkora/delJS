ways of dealing with multiplication with real numbers:

1- simply using the normal multiplication function in all cases:
pros: 
  -simpler to code
  -cleaner and more intuitive
cons:
  -harder to evaluate equality when attempting to simplify equations (3*sen(x) + 5*sen(x) would be harder to understand as 8*sen(x))

2 - adding an "factor" field to every DFO:
pros:
  -easier to assess equality
  -diminishes number of multiplication DFOs with only two terms when dealing with products with constants
cons:
  -messy as all hell
  -not intuitive

3 - add special "multiply with real constant" function:
pros: 
  -easy to code
  -easy to consider assessing equality
cons:
  -still messy, a bit unintuitive

extra argument: 
  dealing with assessing equality is going to be hard anyway, making a single case easier won't save you
  still valid dealing with sign specifically
